<p> Hello and welcome to our site!</p>
<p> We are two students currently learning to code with <a href="https://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk" > Code First Girls </a>. </p>
<p> When asked to build a website based upon an issue we are passionate about our thoughts went immediately to this: Homelessness.</p>
<p>Homelessness is a growing issue in Manchester and we don't believe enough is being done to address it. By donating as little as a couple of pounds we can help homeless people to survive another day. However this doesn't help them in the long-term. More needs to be done. We need to get rough sleepers into housing, rather than just helping them survive on the streets.</p>
<p>I'm sure you have noticed the number of people sleeping rough on the streets of Manchester is ever increasing. The City Council of Manchester has reported an increase in the number of people asking them for help by 155%!</p>
<p>Homeless MCR is on a mission to tackle this problem and we hope to be able to eliminate it altogether by the year 2025. However, we can't do this without your support, so please get in touch if you would like to get involved.</p>
<p>On this site, you will find profiles of several homeless people we have interviewed, where you are most likely find them in the city - by using the map provided - as well as some facts and figures relating to the subject. </p>
